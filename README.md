# **NFT Trading Platform - Summary**

## **Introduction**
This project is a **multiplayer NFT trading platform** that allows users to **buy, sell, and trade NFT cards** on the **Avalanche blockchain**. The platform features a **3D virtual table in Unreal Engine**, where users can interact, display their NFT cards, and communicate via **voice chat**. 

The system consists of:
- A **mobile app (React Native)** for user access and NFT management.
- A **backend (Java API + PostgreSQL)** for authentication, trade history, and NFT metadata.
- A **blockchain service (C#)** for smart contract interactions and USDT transactions.
- A **game server (Unreal Engine)** for the **multiplayer trading experience**.
- **Cybersecurity** and **operating system optimizations** to ensure safety and performance.

---

## **What is the Idea?**
The idea is to **combine blockchain-based NFT trading** with a **real-time, interactive gaming experience**. Instead of using traditional NFT marketplaces, users will **sit at a virtual table, display their NFT cards, negotiate via voice chat, and trade securely using smart contracts**.

---

## **Goal**
The goal is to create a **secure, user-friendly, and immersive environment** where:
- Players can **showcase, trade, and negotiate** NFT card deals.
- Blockchain transactions happen **seamlessly in the background**.
- Users can **purchase NFTs with USDT or swap them with other users**.

This platform blends **gaming, finance, and blockchain technology** into a unique **e-commerce experience for digital assets**.

---

## **What the Users Do?**
Users can:
1. **Sign up and log in** via the mobile app.
2. **Connect their Avalanche wallet** (MetaMask or WalletConnect).
3. **View their NFT collection** inside the app.
4. **List NFTs for sale** or **trade NFTs with other players**.
5. **Enter the Unreal Engine multiplayer space** to meet and negotiate trades.
6. **Use voice chat** to discuss NFT values before confirming a trade.
7. **Execute a trade or purchase NFTs using USDT** via smart contracts.

---

## **What the Application Does?**
The application:
- **Stores and manages user accounts** securely.
- **Retrieves NFT ownership data** from Avalanche blockchain.
- **Allows users to list and buy NFTs** using smart contracts.
- **Syncs with Unreal Engine** to show real-time NFT assets in a 3D space.
- **Processes transactions securely** using USDT and NFT swaps.
- **Manages voice chat communication** during trades.

## **What the Application Has as Tech Details?**
| Component | Technology |
|------------|-------------|
| **Mobile App** | React Native (TypeScript) |
| **Backend API** | Java (Spring Boot) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL |
| **Blockchain Service** | C# (Interacts with Avalanche) |
| **Game Server** | Unreal Engine (Multiplayer, Voice Chat) |
| **Storage** | IPFS/Arweave (NFT metadata) |
| **Authentication** | JWT, OAuth 2.0 |
| **Security** | DDoS protection, HTTPS, Smart Contract Audits |
| **Hosting** | AWS/DigitalOcean for API & DB, Dedicated server for Unreal |

## **How Each Part Connects**
1. **Mobile App ↔ Java API**  
   - The mobile app **sends user requests** (login, NFT list, trade actions).  
   - Java API **processes user authentication and NFT metadata**.  

2. **Java API ↔ C# Blockchain Service**  
   - Java API calls the C# service to **execute NFT transactions** on Avalanche.  
   - The C# service **mints, transfers, and verifies NFT ownership**.  

3. **Unreal Engine ↔ Java API**  
   - When users enter the **trading table**, Unreal fetches **NFT details from the Java API**.  
   - The API synchronizes real-time trade updates.  

4. **Unreal Engine ↔ C# Blockchain Service**  
   - When a trade is **finalized in the game**, C# handles the **smart contract transaction**.  
   - Ownership updates on **Avalanche blockchain** and reflects in the mobile app.  

5. **Cybersecurity Measures**  
   - **All API calls are encrypted** (TLS 1.3).  
   - **Role-based access control (RBAC)** prevents unauthorized actions.  
   - **DDoS protection** shields servers from spam attacks.

## **What Each Part Will Do**
### **C# (Blockchain Service)**
- **Handles all smart contract interactions** on Avalanche.
- **Executes NFT transfers and USDT payments**.
- **Verifies NFT ownership** before trades are finalized.
- **Updates transaction records** on the blockchain.

### **API + Java (Backend)**
- **Manages users & authentication (JWT)**
- **Fetches NFT data from the blockchain**
- **Handles trade history storage**
- **Connects mobile app, Unreal Engine, and C# blockchain service**

### **Mobile (React Native)**
- **Displays user’s NFT collection**
- **Allows users to list NFTs for sale**
- **Initiates NFT trades and purchases (USDT transactions)**
- **Connects to MetaMask or other Avalanche wallets**

### **Unreal Engine (Game Server)**
- **Creates a 3D trading table space**
- **Allows players to display NFT cards in-game**
- **Handles multiplayer sessions & voice chat**
- **Triggers blockchain transactions when a trade is confirmed**

### **Cybersecurity**
- **Implements DDoS protection for game & API servers**
- **Encrypts sensitive data (AES-256 for database, TLS 1.3 for API)**
- **Applies smart contract security audits to prevent exploits**
- **Uses OAuth 2.0 & multi-signature wallets for large transactions**
- **Prevents brute-force attacks with rate limiting & firewalls**

### **Operating Systems**
- **Game Server (Unreal Engine Multiplayer)** → Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (for security & performance)
- **Application Server (API & Blockchain Service)** → Ubuntu 22.04 or Windows Server 2022 (depending on cloud provider)
- **Database Server (PostgreSQL)** → Hosted on **AWS RDS** or **Google Cloud SQL** for **auto-scaling & backups**
- **Mobile App Deployment** → Hosted on **Google Play Store / Apple App Store**
